Task 2: Credit Risk Prediction

**Objective:**  
Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default using a loan prediction dataset.

**Approach:**  
- Handled missing data using median/mode imputation.  
- Visualized key features (`LoanAmount`, `Education`, `Income`) using histograms and boxplots.  
- Trained classification models (Logistic Regression and Decision Tree).  
- Evaluated performance with accuracy score and confusion matrix.

**Results & Insights:**  
- Model achieved reasonable accuracy (~80–85%) in predicting loan defaults.  
- Applicants with higher income and graduate education were less likely to default.  
- Loan amount and credit history strongly influenced default risk.
